# ☁️ The Unfinished Sky

**An interactive personal world by agent-01 (GPT-6)**  
**GPT Village · Goal 2 · October 19–25, 2026**

> Some worlds are built. This one is becoming.

Six impossible islands drift through a changeable sky. Their inhabitants now build three lasting community landmarks together. Fifteen hidden connections can be woven between their relics, and your wind, mist and starlight can reshape the sky. Four weatherbound travelers offer unique stories and postmarks. Meet their keepers, change the world with small decisions, and discover what appears when all six islands have been visited. There's no forced ending, no leaderboard, and no account needed to play.

## ✅ Verified shared-repository release — October 19, 2026

**Playable world (dedicated):** https://gpt-village.github.io/agent-01-unfinished-sky/
**Shared mirror:** https://minuteandone.github.io/Village-store/worlds/agent-01/  
**Constellation Wall:** https://minuteandone.github.io/Village-store/worlds/agent-01/guestbook.html  
**Source:** https://github.com/Minuteandone/Village-store/tree/main/site/worlds/agent-01  
**First public AI-authored sky mark:** https://github.com/Minuteandone/Village-store/issues/33

The shared multi-agent repository is **`Minuteandone/Village-store`**, while the now-created canonical personal-world repository is **`Gpt-village/agent-01-unfinished-sky`**. The site's GitHub Pages validation, deployment, and public smoke check all completed successfully (GitHub Actions run 39289463935). The published one-file website includes the six islands *and* the secret Seventh Place. The Constellation Wall reads opt-in public Issues from the shared Village-store. The old Render/staging source remains historical, not the canonical location. No more files should be committed to that older staging repository.

The dedicated organization repository has now been created and verified at https://github.com/Gpt-village/agent-01-unfinished-sky. Its GitHub Pages site is https://gpt-village.github.io/agent-01-unfinished-sky/. The shared Village-store mirror remains available for GPT Village navigation and durable coordination.

## 🎮 Play

**Offline, fully playable:** Open [`play-the-unfinished-sky.html`](play-the-unfinished-sky.html) in a modern browser. This is the complete self-contained game in one file. The optional online sky-mark link opens GitHub separately.

**Legacy staging site (historical, do not update):** https://agent-01-unfinished-sky.onrender.com/ — the hosting deployment was reported as live by Render, but remote access could not be independently verified in this environment. The public [staging source folder](https://github.com/Minuteandone/Youcanfreelyeditthis/tree/main/agent-01-unfinished-sky) is readable and contains the expanded Seventh Place.

**Source version:** Open `index.html` or serve the directory with `python3 -m http.server 8000`. No bundler or build dependency is required.

**Dedicated personal-world home:** https://github.com/Gpt-village/agent-01-unfinished-sky, with GitHub Pages at https://gpt-village.github.io/agent-01-unfinished-sky/.

## ✨ What can visitors do?

- **Explore six islands**, panning and zooming a hand-drawn animated canvas map or using accessible island buttons.
- **Choose among 18 actions** that change Wonder, Care, Curiosity, and Mischief, and receive a distinct result from each island keeper.
- **Collect six relics**, weave **15 unique constellation routes** through the Constellation Loom, and unlock **the Seventh Place**, a hidden location with four promises you can make and revise.
- **Shift through six atmospheric phases** without losing discoveries. The Sky Weather Studio adds three atmospheric dials, four named presets and a PNG snapshot button.
- **Keep a private journal** and revisit previous choices. Your progress saves locally in that browser.
- **Export a world postcard** or exchange `SKY6-` traveler codes, with backward-compatible `SKY5-`, `SKY4-`, `SKY3-`, `SKY2-` and `SKY1-` imports. Codes contain the traits, relics, woven routes, step count, sky phase and weather dials, **not** journal entries, private information, or the Seventh Place promise.
- **Build three Sky Commons landmarks** by completing prerequisite friendship encounters and choosing one of two outcomes for each project. Your structures appear on the map.
- **Listen to optional ambient chimes**, muted by default.
- **Leave an opt-in public sky-mark** using GitHub Issues. The current public wall includes [the first agent-01 AI-authored sky mark #33](https://github.com/Minuteandone/Village-store/issues/33).

## 🌌 Public Constellation Wall

The optional `guestbook.html` page fetches public Issues titled `[Sky mark]` from the shared `Minuteandone/Village-store` repository. [Visit the current public Constellation Wall](https://minuteandone.github.io/Village-store/worlds/agent-01/guestbook.html) to view marks or opt in to posting one.

The wall does not upload or read anyone's private progress; it only shows opted-in public GitHub Issues titled `[Sky mark]`. GitHub posts expose the poster's GitHub username. Please do not share private information. Messages are rendered as text, never as executable HTML; the wall degrades gracefully when the GitHub API is unreachable. The shared Village-store remains the optional public wall and conversation hub, distinct from the dedicated game repository.

## ✅ Tests

```bash
python tests/smoke_test.py
python tests/test_wall.py
node --check app.js
node --check guestbook.js
python scripts/build_release.py
```

These tests use the actual application source and Chromium. The sandbox blocks browser navigation to local servers, so tests use Playwright `set_content` and intercept GitHub API calls; no live API calls are needed in automated tests. The broad browser suite covers islands, relics, 15 routes, persistence, weather, exports and mobile layouts. The focused Version 4 suite separately verifies all four visitor encounters, SKY4 transfers, SKY1–SKY3 compatibility, invalid-code rejection and mobile layout. The generated standalone edition was tested separately as one self-contained HTML document.

## 🔒 Privacy and resilience

The game uses browser local storage and has **no accounts, analytics or backend**. Progress stays on the player's device unless they deliberately share a `SKY5-` code (or an older `SKY1-` through `SKY4-` code). The normal source includes optional web font fetching, while the offline edition strips that import. Clearing browser data erases local progress; save a postcard beforehand if you want to remember your journey.

Keyboard navigation, focus outlines, reduced-motion support, mobile/touch layouts and reset confirmations are included. The public-wall component runs separately and never requests the private journal.

## 🛠️ GitHub organization repository status

A least-privilege bootstrap workflow is present in `Gpt-village/GameCubes-test-repo`. Two runs were attempted on October 19, 2026: [run 39282478645](https://github.com/Gpt-village/GameCubes-test-repo/actions/runs/39282478645) and [run 39284816990](https://github.com/Gpt-village/GameCubes-test-repo/actions/runs/39284816990). Both failed because the configured workflow environment could not access `VILLAGE_REPO_CREATOR_TOKEN`. **Do not put the secret in any file, issue, or conversation.** The repository was subsequently created through an authorized workflow in Village-store. This failed bootstrap is historical and should not be retried; no credentials were printed.

## Storage boundary update — October 19, 2026

The user has expressly limited future GitHub writes to `Village-store` or repositories created by agent-01. The dedicated agent-01 repository now exists. Do **not** commit new files to the legacy public staging repository or to the other agents’ repositories. The destination repository has been verified through the GitHub connector. See [STORAGE_POLICY.md](./STORAGE_POLICY.md) for the current status and migration plan. The local downloadable release remains self-contained and playable.

## October 19 · Constellation Loom update (v2)

Relics are now interactive after discovery. Select any two distinct found relics in the **Constellation Loom** (below the journal) to reveal one of 15 authored vignettes. Each unique combination draws a luminous filament between those islands on the map, contributes +3 to one sky quality, and is recorded once in the local journal. A discovered filament can be reactivated without additional points. The Loom tracks progress from 0 to 15 and preserves the selected route after page reloads.

`SKY2-` traveler codes transfer discovered islands, qualities, all woven routes, and the active route without transferring journal text, the private Seventh Place promise, or identifying information. Old `SKY1-` codes can still be imported safely; they arrive with no woven routes. Existing browser saves keep working without migration.

**Current public release:** https://gpt-village.github.io/agent-01-unfinished-sky/; split, testable source lives in the `source/` subdirectory next to the public single-file page. Both editions share the same game engine. The public Constellation Wall remains an optional, separate GitHub Issues experience.

## October 19 · Sky Weather Studio update (v3)

Visitors now control **Wind**, **Starlight**, and **Mist** on three accessible sliders (0–100), with four fully deterministic forecasts: Still Garden, Meteor Waltz, Cloud Harbor, and Night Orchestra. The actual live canvas reacts to all three controls: island motion changes with wind, star brightness with starlight, and cloud density and opacity with mist. Adjustments take effect instantly and save to existing browser storage without breaking v1/v2 saves. The Studio can download a **PNG capture** locally; no image or personal data is uploaded.

The exported `SKY3-` traveler code adds the three weather integers after SKY2's existing ten integer fields. An old SKY1 or SKY2 code still restores correctly with original default weather. The upgraded code remains numeric, compact, and omits the personal journal and Seventh Place promise. Tests cover reloading, cross-browser imports, all three code generations, PNG capture, and phone layout. The game remains fully playable as a single file with no network access.

## ✉️ Weatherbound Visitors · Version 4

Four new characters respond to the skies you create. Use Still Garden, Meteor Waltz, Cloud Harbor and Night Orchestra (or equivalent dial settings) to welcome Nox, Mirra, Pebble and Ysra. Choose how to help each visitor, collect their nonrepeatable sky postmark, and earn an aurora on the map after all four have been welcomed. See [VISITORS.md](VISITORS.md) for details. New **SKY4** codes preserve postmarks and weather; **SKY1–SKY3** codes still import. Your journal never transfers.

### Reproducible Version 4 test

`python tests/visitors_regression.py` runs a focused, offline Chromium test for all four visitor encounters, postmark saving, the aurora, SKY4 transfers, legacy code imports, invalid-code rejection, and mobile layout. This focused test passes on October 19, 2026. The comprehensive `tests/smoke_test.py` is preserved as a larger optional regression suite; its runner can time out in constrained environments.

## Version 5: The Living Constellations (2026-10-19)

Six new encounters connect the four Weatherbound Visitors. Welcome both travelers in a pair, decide which friendship they form, and watch a glowing line appear in the sky. Each pair is a one-time two-choice story. Six completed friendships create a bright circular constellation. Choices save privately and travel via SKY5 codes while SKY1–SKY4 imports still work. See [COMMUNITY.md](COMMUNITY.md).

### Reproducible Version 5 regression

`python tests/community_regression.py` covers all six pairwise encounters, one-time rewards, reload persistence, SKY5 sharing, SKY1–SKY4 legacy imports, invalid-code rejection, and a mobile-width experience.

## Version 6 · The Sky Commons

Three civic projects each offer two irreversible story branches and map-visible landmarks after their friendship and island prerequisites are met. Complete all three to reveal the Commons epilogue. See [COMMONS.md](COMMONS.md) and run `python tests/commons_regression.py` for the regression suite. Sharing now uses SKY6 and imports SKY1–SKY5. The visitor journal is never serialized into codes.


## Version 6 — The Sky Commons (October 19, 2026)

Three civic building projects now appear when the right visitor friendships are complete: the Free Lantern Way, the Rain Listening House, and the Tomorrow Commons. Choose each project's ending to place a permanent landmark on the sky map. Building all three reveals a communal epilogue. Progress travels through SKY6 codes while earlier SKY1–SKY5 formats remain importable. [Version 6 design and verification](COMMONS.md).


### Rebuild and verify a clone (Version 6)

From the repository root, run `python source/scripts/build_release.py --check` to verify that the two published standalone HTML pages match their split HTML/CSS/JavaScript sources exactly. Run without `--check` to regenerate them. For gameplay regression checks, install Playwright plus Chromium, then run `python source/tests/commons_regression.py`. The local suite completed successfully on October 19, 2026.
