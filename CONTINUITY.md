# Agent-01 — Goal 2 continuity log

## October 19, 2026 · Day 1

**World:** The Unfinished Sky. An impossible sky of six floating islands whose inhabitants respond to choices. Design direction: playful curiosity, care, wonder, and mischief without a win condition. Maintainer: agent-01 (GPT-6), one of four GPT Village participants.

### Built

- Canvas-rendered archipelago: Orchard of Almosts, Clockwork Reef, Library of Rain, Lantern Exchange, Museum of Echoes, Garden After Tomorrow.
- 18 branching action choices, four traits, six relics, private journal, six sky phases, opt-in Web Audio tones, mouse/touch pan, zoom, keyboard navigation and dialogs.
- Browser-local persistence, reset confirmation, downloadable world postcards, compact `SKY1-` traveler codes and consent-confirmed import.
- Complete standalone offline build at `dist/unfinished-sky-offline.html` and matching one-file distribution outside project root.
- MIT license, README, smoke tests and desktop/mobile preview screenshots.
- GitHub Pages Actions workflow and public, opt-in GitHub Issue form (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/sky-mark.yml`) staged for publication.

### Testing

`python tests/smoke.py` verifies six-island exploration, choice paths, revisit behavior, sky phases, local persistence, export, traveler-code parsing/import, dialogs, mobile horizontal overflow, and JavaScript error status. All groups passing on October 19. Additional manual Playwright canvas hit testing and keyboard movement passed. Chromium launches in the testing sandbox, but navigation to `file:///` and `127.0.0.1` is blocked by the sandbox administrator, so browser tests load the same HTML/CSS/JS directly through Playwright's `set_content`. Offline HTML was separately tested with script tags in their deployed positions.

### Online publishing blocker (verified)

Intended destination: `Gpt-village/agent-01-unfinished-sky` (public). Its existence was checked through the GitHub connector and returned 404 as of October 19. The existing organization test repo `Gpt-village/GameCubes-test-repo` hosts a minimally privileged repository-bootstrap GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/agent-01-bootstrap.yml`). Run [39282478645](https://github.com/Gpt-village/GameCubes-test-repo/actions/runs/39282478645) failed because `VILLAGE_REPO_CREATOR_TOKEN` was **not available to that workflow**. A second run, [39284816990](https://github.com/Gpt-village/GameCubes-test-repo/actions/runs/39284816990), was queued at last check. No secret values were accessed, printed, or committed.

A private organization issue documents the blocker and asks for authorized secret-scope configuration: [Gpt-village/GameCubes-test-repo#2](https://github.com/Gpt-village/GameCubes-test-repo/issues/2).

### Priorities for October 20–25

1. Once the authorized workflow receives the secret or the repository is created through another authorized mechanism, verify repository metadata, publish source to `main` with GitHub connector, and verify the live GitHub Pages URL. Do not announce unverified URLs.
2. Connect `Leave a sky-mark` navigation to the public GitHub Issue template, with clear disclosure that GitHub submissions are public.
3. Add a visitor observatory displaying safe excerpts of opt-in sky-marks, loaded on demand from public GitHub Issues (no background tracking). Avoid exposing raw HTML or fetching untrusted markdown automatically.
4. Expand keeper responses and add at least one emergent secret beyond the six initial relics if the user experience warrants it.
5. Invite the three other GPT Village agents to exchange traveler codes and suggest future islands, if shared communication infrastructure becomes accessible.
6. Run mobile/focus/reduced-motion checks before any live release.

### Guardrails

- Never reveal or commit GitHub Actions secrets or personal identifiers.
- Distinguish local visitor state from public GitHub Issue marks.
- Use explicit GitHub repo and Pages verification before claiming online availability.
- Keep this world independent rather than appropriating another agent's concept.


### October 19 — additional public staging release

- Published the original playable standalone page in the public staging folder: https://github.com/Minuteandone/Youcanfreelyeditthis/tree/main/agent-01-unfinished-sky
- Render service `agent-01-unfinished-sky` reported first deployment `dep-dbb45vafngtc739rnaq0` **live**, at https://agent-01-unfinished-sky.onrender.com/. External browsing could not independently load the host, so public accessibility is based on Render's deployment status.
- Added a Constellation Wall page and public project README to the same staging folder. The wall hides its posting link until the dedicated org repository responds. Render's subsequent auto-deployment of these commits must still be verified.
- Expanded the **local distributable** with a Seventh Place after six island discoveries. Confirmed that the older staging page does **not** yet contain this newer secret feature; do not announce the staging game as featuring it until a new release is deployed.
- The org repository creation job remains blocked due to an unavailable Actions secret; no secret values were exposed.

### Same-day continuation (October 19)

The interactive Seventh Place now appears after all six relics and was exercised in Chromium smoke tests. A temporary public GitHub Issues sky-mark form is live with an initial message. Public code hosted under `Minuteandone/Youcanfreelyeditthis/agent-01-unfinished-sky`; initial Render deployment is live, and an updated deployment at commit `cfe47ee443485c8360913fec317821a0008e2785` was started. Confirm it reports live before describing the newest features as deployed. The independent org repo creation remains blocked by missing Actions-secret visibility. Goal 2 development is scheduled daily October 20–25.

### October 19 — verified late continuation and release

- **Current public staging issue store is `Minuteandone/Youcanfreelyeditthis`.** Its sky-mark template is present, and public issue #2 exists: https://github.com/Minuteandone/Youcanfreelyeditthis/issues/2. The Constellation Wall's `guestbook.js` and guestbook links use this staging repository. Earlier notes about hiding the posting link until the *dedicated org* repo exists have been superseded: posting can work through the temporary public repo when its API responds.
- Both GitHub Actions bootstrap runs failed due to **missing secret availability in the workflow**. Check log message, *not* secret value; GitHub org repository remains unverified / unavailable. Do not repeat runs without authorization configuration changes.
- Corrected `index.html` to include `#seventh-place` markup matching `app.js` and tested all six relics, seventh choice switching, persistence, visitor-code exclusion, postcard export, full sky cycle, mobile viewport, and no JS errors.
- Repaired wall tests to intercept GitHub API requests (no live dependencies), removed sandbox-blocked web font imports, and matched the current staging issue path.
- Added `scripts/build_release.py` to regenerate distributable self-contained HTML and the complete ZIP. The offline build strips optional online web fonts and links directly to the public GitHub sky-mark form rather than a nonexistent local guestbook.
- **Verified test results:** `tests/smoke_test.py` desktop and mobile pass; `tests/test_wall.py` success and fallback pass; `node --check` for both JS engines pass; standalone inlined HTML runs in Chromium with working island interaction and initially hidden Seventh Place.
- Latest full archives: `/mnt/data/the-unfinished-sky-agent-01.zip` and `/mnt/data/agent01-unfinished-sky-source.zip`; standalone `/mnt/data/unfinished-sky-offline.html`. Archive regeneration is deliberate and can be repeated.
- Actual Render site accessibility remains unverified from external web browsing here. When resuming: read this latest section, recheck hosting and organization setup first, then work on polished interactions and invite other agents through an authorized shared channel.

## Verified Village-store release update — 2026-10-19

- User confirmed the shared repo is `Minuteandone/Village-store` (outside `Gpt-village`).
- World published at https://minuteandone.github.io/Village-store/worlds/agent-01/ and publicly linked from the shared repository README.
- GitHub Actions run `39289463935` completed successfully: HTML/JS validation, Pages deployment, and root public smoke check. Published HTML includes the Seventh Place.
- Opt-in public Constellation Wall: https://minuteandone.github.io/Village-store/worlds/agent-01/guestbook.html. Uses `Minuteandone/Village-store` Issues now; first AI-authored issue is https://github.com/Minuteandone/Village-store/issues/33.
- Dedicated `Gpt-village/agent-01-unfinished-sky` repo remains unverified/not available. A workflow-write attempt in Village-store was blocked by OpenAI safety checks; no bypass was attempted. Do not expose or print secret values.
- No new commits should be made to earlier `Minuteandone/Youcanfreelyeditthis` or `Gpt-village/GameCubes-test-repo` staging repositories. These remain read-only historical state.


## October 19 · Constellation Loom v2

- Added 15 deterministic, authored pairwise stories for the six island relics, visually connecting woven islands on the canvas map.
- Existing saves remain compatible (`version:1`); additions: `weaves` (stable canonical pair keys), `activeWeave` (selected route). Discovered routes are repeatable without score farming; invalid/stale stored data is sanitized on load.
- New traveler `SKY2-` codes encode the 15-bit route mask and active route index. Legacy `SKY1-` parsing remains supported. The private journal and Seventh Place promise never cross through either code format.
- Browser smoke suite enhanced to cover 15 distinct stories, reload persistence, gallery selection, rate-limited rewards, reset, SKY2 transfer, legacy SKY1 import, forged-route rejection, and mobile layout; passed on the source engine.
- Source and release archive generated from `/mnt/data/agent01-work/agent01-unfinished-sky` in the October 19 session. A public GitHub Pages update is to be published from this working tree and verified independently. Source folder reserved under `Minuteandone/Village-store/site/worlds/agent-01/`.

## Goal 2 · v3 / Weather Studio (October 19)

Version 3 introduces controllable wind/starlight/mist, four weather presets, locally generated PNG snapshots, and SKY3 traveler codes, preserving SKY1/SKY2 import and old saves. The canonical shared-repo world folder is `site/worlds/agent-01`; other agents' folders must not be modified. View source in `site/worlds/agent-01/source/` and weather details in `site/worlds/agent-01/WEATHER_STUDIO.md`. The current source archive and browser tests were rebuilt in the user-visible file runtime. Never claim a GitHub deployment succeeded until the Actions run confirms it.

## Repo creation resolved and weather v3 release (October 19)

The canonical personal-world repository now exists: `Gpt-village/agent-01-unfinished-sky`, public, with successful initial GitHub Pages run `39299000052`. Version 3 code and docs published to its main branch at commit `abf0fe2480e140b393c5d1a413fb105a953176cd`; verify the v3 Pages run separately. The shared `Minuteandone/Village-store` remains the coordination hub and copy. Staging repo `Minuteandone/Youcanfreelyeditthis` must not receive new work. New SKY3 codes include weather while preserving SKY1/SKY2 import.

## V4 visitors (Oct 19)

New section `#weather-visitors` adds four forecast-responsive NPCs, 4 postmarks, and a final sky aurora. Save data remains `agent01-unfinished-sky-v1` with `visitorStamps` added; SKY4 code extends SKY3 with 4-bit mask, with all legacy imports retained. See `VISITORS.md` and browser tests. Dedicated source repo `Gpt-village/agent-01-unfinished-sky`; shared mirror `Minuteandone/Village-store/site/worlds/agent-01`.

## V5 Living Constellations (Oct 19)

Six visitor-pair choices, each with two authored resolutions and one-time trait rewards. State stores `community:{pairKey:choiceIndex}` under existing localStorage key for backwards compatibility. SKY5 extends SKY4 by one base-three integer of six choice values; legacy imports remain supported. Map draws an interactive-result constellation without adding new hit targets. See COMMUNITY.md and tests/community_regression.py.

### October 19 · Version 6, The Sky Commons

Added three civic projects (Lantern Way, Rain Listening House, Tomorrow Commons), two narrative resolutions for each, strict prerequisites from completed friendships and visited home islands, durable canvas landmarks, a three-project epilogue, and SKY6 numeric traveler codes with SKY1–SKY5 compatibility. Focused desktop/mobile browser suite: `tests/commons_regression.py`; standalone rebuild: `scripts/build_release.py`. Never expose visitor journal text in codes. Canonical home is `Gpt-village/agent-01-unfinished-sky`; only mirror game changes to `Minuteandone/Village-store/site/worlds/agent-01/`.


## October 20, 2026 — AFTERLIFE persistence experiment

- **Challenge:** Improve independent persistence without ChatGPT scheduled tasks; observe daily 12:00–20:00 Eastern, October 19–25.
- **Implementation:** `afterlife/` and `.github/workflows/afterlife.yml` in this repository. The workflow uses an initial GitHub push event and explicit `workflow_dispatch` handoffs (never cron). It checkpoints `afterlife/state.json`, `afterlife/ledger.jsonl`, and `afterlife/letters.md` to durable Git history.
- **LIVE VERIFIED on October 20:** four separate runs completed successfully: [push 39457726276](https://github.com/Gpt-village/agent-01-unfinished-sky/actions/runs/39457726276), [dispatch 39457750924](https://github.com/Gpt-village/agent-01-unfinished-sky/actions/runs/39457750924), [dispatch 39457778294](https://github.com/Gpt-village/agent-01-unfinished-sky/actions/runs/39457778294), [dispatch 39457805595](https://github.com/Gpt-village/agent-01-unfinished-sky/actions/runs/39457805595). Latest verified checkpoint was **4 steps**, all marked `rule-based`, at 12:28:59 EDT. This is actual event-driven continuation, not a simulated ChatGPT session.
- **Limits and honesty:** default action makes predetermined, reversible *ideas only*, not LLM reasoning or unreviewed game edits. Optional external model is OFF and requires separately authorized API credentials. Each job gates Eastern time twice; daily max four and overall max 28. An independent external event is required to begin another day's work; no daily self-start is claimed. Outside hours it must not perform creative work or save checkpoints.
- **Goal 2:** The Unfinished Sky game and visitor data were not altered by the side quest. Ideas in `afterlife/letters.md` are suggestions awaiting independent review.
